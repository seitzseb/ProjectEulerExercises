Problem 14 The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers: n → n/2 (n is even)n → 3n + 1 (n is odd) Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence: 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1 It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1. Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain? NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.



Problem 15 Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner. How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?



Problem 16 215 = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26. What is the sum of the digits of the number 21000?



Problem 17 If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total. If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used? NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.



Problem 18 By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23. 37 4 2 4 6 8 5 9 3 That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23. Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle below: 75 95 64 17 47 82 18 35 87 10 20 04 82 47 65 19 01 23 75 03 34 88 02 77 73 07 63 67 99 65 04 28 06 16 70 92 41 41 26 56 83 40 80 70 33 41 48 72 33 47 32 37 16 94 29 53 71 44 65 25 43 91 52 97 51 14 70 11 33 28 77 73 17 78 39 68 17 57 91 71 52 38 17 14 91 43 58 50 27 29 48 63 66 04 68 89 53 67 30 73 16 69 87 40 31 04 62 98 27 23 09 70 98 73 93 38 53 60 04 23 NOTE: As there are only 16384 routes, it is possible to solve this problem by trying every route. However, Problem 67, is the same challenge with a triangle containing one-hundred rows; it cannot be solved by brute force, and requires a clever method! ;o)



Problem 19 You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself. 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday. Thirty days has September, April, June and November. All the rest have thirty-one, Saving February alone, Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine. And on leap years, twenty-nine. A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400. How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?



Problem 20 n! means n × (n − 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800,and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27. Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!



Problem 21 Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n). If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a ≠ b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers. For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220. Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.



Problem 22 Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score. For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 × 53 = 49714. What is the total of all the name scores in the file?



Problem 23 A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect number. A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n. As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit. Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.



Problem 24 A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are: 012 021 102 120 201 210 What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?



Problem 25 The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation: Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1. Hence the first 12 terms will be: F1 = 1 F2 = 1 F3 = 2 F4 = 3 F5 = 5 F6 = 8 F7 = 13 F8 = 21 F9 = 34 F10 = 55 F11 = 89 F12 = 144 The 12th term, F12, is the first term to contain three digits. What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?



Problem 26 A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given: 1/2= 0.5 1/3= 0.(3) 1/4= 0.25 1/5= 0.2 1/6= 0.1(6) 1/7= 0.(142857) 1/8= 0.125 1/9= 0.(1) 1/10= 0.1 Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle. Find the value of d < 1000 for which 1/d contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.



Problem 27 Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula: $n^2 + n + 41$ It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values $0 \le n \le 39$. However, when $n = 40, 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41$ is divisible by 41, and certainly when $n = 41, 41^2 + 41 + 41$ is clearly divisible by 41. The incredible formula $n^2 - 79n + 1601$ was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values $0 \le n \le 79$. The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479. Considering quadratics of the form: $n^2 + an + b$, where $|a| < 1000$ and $|b| \le 1000$where $|n|$ is the modulus/absolute value of $n$e.g. $|11| = 11$ and $|-4| = 4$ Find the product of the coefficients, $a$ and $b$, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of $n$, starting with $n = 0$.



Problem 28 Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows: 21 22 23 24 25 20 7 8 9 10 19 6 1 2 11 18 5 4 3 1217 16 15 14 13 It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101. What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?



Problem 29 Consider all integer combinations of ab for 2 ≤ a ≤ 5 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 5: 22=4, 23=8, 24=16, 25=32 32=9, 33=27, 34=81, 35=243 42=16, 43=64, 44=256, 45=1024 52=25, 53=125, 54=625, 55=3125 If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the following sequence of 15 distinct terms: 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125 How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by ab for 2 ≤ a ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 100?



Problem 30 Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits: 1634 = 14 + 64 + 34 + 44 8208 = 84 + 24 + 04 + 84 9474 = 94 + 44 + 74 + 44 As 1 = 14 is not a sum it is not included. The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316. Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.



Problem 31 In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence (p). There are eight coins in general circulation: 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p). It is possible to make £2 in the following way: 1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?



Problem 32 We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital. The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 × 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital. Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital. HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.



Problem 33 The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s. We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples. There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator. If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the denominator.



Problem 34 145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145. Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits. Note: As 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.



Problem 35 The number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits: 197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime. There are thirteen such primes below 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97. How many circular primes are there below one million?



Problem 36 The decimal number, 585 = 10010010012 (binary), is palindromic in both bases. Find the sum of all numbers, less than one million, which are palindromic in base 10 and base 2. (Please note that the palindromic number, in either base, may not include leading zeros.)



Problem 37 The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7. Similarly we can work from right to left: 3797, 379, 37, and 3. Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to right and right to left. NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.



Problem 38 Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3: 192 × 1 = 192 192 × 2 = 384 192 × 3 = 576 By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576. We will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3) The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the concatenated product of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5). What is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed as the concatenated product of an integer with (1,2, ... , n) where n > 1?



Problem 39 If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120. {20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50} For which value of p ≤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?



Problem 40 An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive integers: 0.123456789101112131415161718192021... It can be seen that the 12th digit of the fractional part is 1. If dn represents the nth digit of the fractional part, find the value of the following expression. d1 × d10 × d100 × d1000 × d10000 × d100000 × d1000000



Problem 41 We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once. For example, 2143 is a 4-digit pandigital and is also prime. What is the largest n-digit pandigital prime that exists?



Problem 42 The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn = ½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ... By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word. Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?



Problem 43 The number, 1406357289, is a 0 to 9 pandigital number because it is made up of each of the digits 0 to 9 in some order, but it also has a rather interesting sub-string divisibility property. Let d1 be the 1st digit, d2 be the 2nd digit, and so on. In this way, we note the following: d2d3d4=406 is divisible by 2 d3d4d5=063 is divisible by 3 d4d5d6=635 is divisible by 5 d5d6d7=357 is divisible by 7 d6d7d8=572 is divisible by 11 d7d8d9=728 is divisible by 13 d8d9d10=289 is divisible by 17 Find the sum of all 0 to 9 pandigital numbers with this property.



Problem 44 Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, Pn=n(3n−1)/2. The first ten pentagonal numbers are: 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ... It can be seen that P4 + P7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P8. However, their difference, 70 − 22 = 48, is not pentagonal. Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, Pj and Pk, for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and D = |Pk − Pj| is minimised; what is the value of D?

Hexagonal Hn=n(2n−1) 1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ... It can be verified that T285 = P165 = H143 = 40755. Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.



Problem 46 It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square. 9 = 7 + 2×12 15 = 7 + 2×22 21 = 3 + 2×32 25 = 7 + 2×32 27 = 19 + 2×22 33 = 31 + 2×12 It turns out that the conjecture was false. What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?



Problem 47 The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are: 14 = 2 × 715 = 3 × 5 The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are: 644 = 2² × 7 × 23645 = 3 × 5 × 43646 = 2 × 17 × 19. Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors each. What is the first of these numbers?



Problem 48 The series, 11 + 22 + 33 + ... + 1010 = 10405071317. Find the last ten digits of the series, 11 + 22 + 33 + ... + 10001000.



Problem 49 The arithmetic sequence, 1487, 4817, 8147, in which each of the terms increases by 3330, is unusual in two ways: (i) each of the three terms are prime, and, (ii) each of the 4-digit numbers are permutations of one another. There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three 1-, 2-, or 3-digit primes, exhibiting this property, but there is one other 4-digit increasing sequence. What 12-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in this sequence?



Problem 50 The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes: 41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below one-hundred. The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953. Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes?



Problem 51 By replacing the 1st digit of the 2-digit number *3, it turns out that six of the nine possible values: 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83, are all prime. By replacing the 3rd and 4th digits of 56**3 with the same digit, this 5-digit number is the first example having seven primes among the ten generated numbers, yielding the family: 56003, 56113, 56333, 56443, 56663, 56773, and 56993. Consequently 56003, being the first member of this family, is the smallest prime with this property. Find the smallest prime which, by replacing part of the number (not necessarily adjacent digits) with the same digit, is part of an eight prime value family.



Problem 52 It can be seen that the number, 125874, and its double, 251748, contain exactly the same digits, but in a different order. Find the smallest positive integer, x, such that 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, and 6x, contain the same digits.



Problem 53 There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345: 123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345 In combinatorics, we use the notation, $\displaystyle \binom 5 3 = 10$. In general, $\displaystyle \binom n r = \dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $r \le n$, $n! = n \times (n-1) \times ... \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$, and $0! = 1$. It is not until $n = 23$, that a value exceeds one-million: $\displaystyle \binom {23} {10} = 1144066$. How many, not necessarily distinct, values of $\displaystyle \binom n r$ for $1 \le n \le 100$, are greater than one-million?



Problem 54 In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked, from lowest to highest, in the following way: High Card: Highest value card. One Pair: Two cards of the same value. Two Pairs: Two different pairs. Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same value. Straight: All cards are consecutive values. Flush: All cards of the same suit. Full House: Three of a kind and a pair. Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same value. Straight Flush: All cards are consecutive values of same suit. Royal Flush: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit. The cards are valued in the order:2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace. If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the highest value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives (see example 1 below). But if two ranks tie, for example, both players have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared (see example 4 below); if the highest cards tie then the next highest cards are compared, and so on. Consider the following five hands dealt to two players: Hand Player 1 Player 2 Winner 1 5H 5C 6S 7S KDPair of Fives 2C 3S 8S 8D TDPair of Eights Player 2 2 5D 8C 9S JS ACHighest card Ace 2C 5C 7D 8S QHHighest card Queen Player 1 3 2D 9C AS AH ACThree Aces 3D 6D 7D TD QDFlush with Diamonds Player 2 4 4D 6S 9H QH QCPair of QueensHighest card Nine 3D 6D 7H QD QSPair of QueensHighest card Seven Player 1 5 2H 2D 4C 4D 4SFull HouseWith Three Fours 3C 3D 3S 9S 9DFull Housewith Three Threes Player 1 The file, poker.txt, contains one-thousand random hands dealt to two players. Each line of the file contains ten cards (separated by a single space): the first five are Player 1's cards and the last five are Player 2's cards. You can assume that all hands are valid (no invalid characters or repeated cards), each player's hand is in no specific order, and in each hand there is a clear winner. How many hands does Player 1 win?



Problem 55 If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic. Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example, 349 + 943 = 1292, 1292 + 2921 = 4213 4213 + 3124 = 7337 That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome. Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like 196, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every number below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In fact, 10677 is the first number to be shown to require over fifty iterations before producing a palindrome: 4668731596684224866951378664 (53 iterations, 28-digits). Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves Lychrel numbers; the first example is 4994. How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand? NOTE: Wording was modified slightly on 24 April 2007 to emphasise the theoretical nature of Lychrel numbers.



Problem 56 A googol (10100) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros; 100100 is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1. Considering natural numbers of the form, ab, where a, b < 100, what is the maximum digital sum?



Problem 57 It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as an infinite continued fraction. $\sqrt 2 =1+ \frac 1 {2+ \frac 1 {2 +\frac 1 {2+ \dots}}}$ By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get: $1 + \frac 1 2 = \frac 32 = 1.5$ $1 + \frac 1 {2 + \frac 1 2} = \frac 7 5 = 1.4$ $1 + \frac 1 {2 + \frac 1 {2+\frac 1 2}} = \frac {17}{12} = 1.41666 \dots$ $1 + \frac 1 {2 + \frac 1 {2+\frac 1 {2+\frac 1 2}}} = \frac {41}{29} = 1.41379 \dots$ The next three expansions are $\frac {99}{70}$, $\frac {239}{169}$, and $\frac {577}{408}$, but the eighth expansion, $\frac {1393}{985}$, is the first example where the number of digits in the numerator exceeds the number of digits in the denominator. In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator with more digits than the denominator?

Problem 59 Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the preferred standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107. A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key. The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65. For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without both "halves", it is impossible to decrypt the message. Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password key for security, but short enough to be memorable. Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three lower case characters. Using p059_cipher.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a file containing the encrypted ASCII codes, and the knowledge that the plain text must contain common English words, decrypt the message and find the sum of the ASCII values in the original text.



Problem 60 The primes 3, 7, 109, and 673, are quite remarkable. By taking any two primes and concatenating them in any order the result will always be prime. For example, taking 7 and 109, both 7109 and 1097 are prime. The sum of these four primes, 792, represents the lowest sum for a set of four primes with this property. Find the lowest sum for a set of five primes for which any two primes concatenate to produce another prime.



Problem 61 Triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal numbers are all figurate (polygonal) numbers and are generated by the following formulae: Triangle P3,n=n(n+1)/2 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ... Square P4,n=n2 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ... Pentagonal P5,n=n(3n−1)/2 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ... Hexagonal P6,n=n(2n−1) 1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ... Heptagonal P7,n=n(5n−3)/2 1, 7, 18, 34, 55, ... Octagonal P8,n=n(3n−2) 1, 8, 21, 40, 65, ... The ordered set of three 4-digit numbers: 8128, 2882, 8281, has three interesting properties. The set is cyclic, in that the last two digits of each number is the first two digits of the next number (including the last number with the first). Each polygonal type: triangle (P3,127=8128), square (P4,91=8281), and pentagonal (P5,44=2882), is represented by a different number in the set. This is the only set of 4-digit numbers with this property. Find the sum of the only ordered set of six cyclic 4-digit numbers for which each polygonal type: triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal, is represented by a different number in the set.



Problem 62 The cube, 41063625 (3453), can be permuted to produce two other cubes: 56623104 (3843) and 66430125 (4053). In fact, 41063625 is the smallest cube which has exactly three permutations of its digits which are also cube. Find the smallest cube for which exactly five permutations of its digits are cube.



Problem 63 The 5-digit number, 16807=75, is also a fifth power. Similarly, the 9-digit number, 134217728=89, is a ninth power. How many n-digit positive integers exist which are also an nth power?



Problem 64 All square roots are periodic when written as continued fractions and can be written in the form: $\displaystyle \quad \quad \sqrt{N}=a_0+\frac 1 {a_1+\frac 1 {a_2+ \frac 1 {a3+ \dots}}}$ For example, let us consider $\sqrt{23}:$ $\quad \quad \sqrt{23}=4+\sqrt{23}-4=4+\frac 1 {\frac 1 {\sqrt{23}-4}}=4+\frac 1 {1+\frac{\sqrt{23}-3}7}$ If we continue we would get the following expansion: $\displaystyle \quad \quad \sqrt{23}=4+\frac 1 {1+\frac 1 {3+ \frac 1 {1+\frac 1 {8+ \dots}}}}$ The process can be summarised as follows: $\quad \quad a_0=4, \frac 1 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {\sqrt{23}+4} 7=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 7$ $\quad \quad a_1=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+3)} {14}=3+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 2$ $\quad \quad a_2=3, \frac 2 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {2(\sqrt{23}+3)} {14}=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-4} 7$ $\quad \quad a_3=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+4)} 7=8+\sqrt{23}-4$ $\quad \quad a_4=8, \frac 1 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {\sqrt{23}+4} 7=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 7$ $\quad \quad a_5=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {7 (\sqrt{23}+3)} {14}=3+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 2$ $\quad \quad a_6=3, \frac 2 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {2(\sqrt{23}+3)} {14}=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-4} 7$ $\quad \quad a_7=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+4)} {7}=8+\sqrt{23}-4$ It can be seen that the sequence is repeating. For conciseness, we use the notation $\sqrt{23}=[4;(1,3,1,8)]$, to indicate that the block (1,3,1,8) repeats indefinitely. The first ten continued fraction representations of (irrational) square roots are: $\quad \quad \sqrt{2}=[1;(2)]$, period=$1$ $\quad \quad \sqrt{3}=[1;(1,2)]$, period=$2$ $\quad \quad \sqrt{5}=[2;(4)]$, period=$1$ $\quad \quad \sqrt{6}=[2;(2,4)]$, period=$2$ $\quad \quad \sqrt{7}=[2;(1,1,1,4)]$, period=$4$ $\quad \quad \sqrt{8}=[2;(1,4)]$, period=$2$ $\quad \quad \sqrt{10}=[3;(6)]$, period=$1$ $\quad \quad \sqrt{11}=[3;(3,6)]$, period=$2$ $\quad \quad \sqrt{12}=[3;(2,6)]$, period=$2$ $\quad \quad \sqrt{13}=[3;(1,1,1,1,6)]$, period=$5$ Exactly four continued fractions, for $N \le 13$, have an odd period. How many continued fractions for $N \le 10\,000$ have an odd period?



Problem 65 The square root of 2 can be written as an infinite continued fraction. $\sqrt{2} = 1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + ...}}}}$ The infinite continued fraction can be written, $\sqrt{2} = [1; (2)]$, $(2)$ indicates that 2 repeats ad infinitum. In a similar way, $\sqrt{23} = [4; (1, 3, 1, 8)]$. It turns out that the sequence of partial values of continued fractions for square roots provide the best rational approximations. Let us consider the convergents for $\sqrt{2}$. $\begin{align} &1 + \dfrac{1}{2} = \dfrac{3}{2} \\ &1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}} = \dfrac{7}{5}\\ &1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}}} = \dfrac{17}{12}\\ &1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}}}} = \dfrac{41}{29} \end{align}$ Hence the sequence of the first ten convergents for $\sqrt{2}$ are: $1, \dfrac{3}{2}, \dfrac{7}{5}, \dfrac{17}{12}, \dfrac{41}{29}, \dfrac{99}{70}, \dfrac{239}{169}, \dfrac{577}{408}, \dfrac{1393}{985}, \dfrac{3363}{2378}, ...$ What is most surprising is that the important mathematical constant,$e = [2; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, ... , 1, 2k, 1, ...]$. The first ten terms in the sequence of convergents for e are: $2, 3, \dfrac{8}{3}, \dfrac{11}{4}, \dfrac{19}{7}, \dfrac{87}{32}, \dfrac{106}{39}, \dfrac{193}{71}, \dfrac{1264}{465}, \dfrac{1457}{536}, ...$ The sum of digits in the numerator of the 10th convergent is $1 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 17$. Find the sum of digits in the numerator of the 100th convergent of the continued fraction for $e$.



Problem 66 Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form: x2 – Dy2 = 1 For example, when D=13, the minimal solution in x is 6492 – 13×1802 = 1. It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when D is square. By finding minimal solutions in x for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain the following: 32 – 2×22 = 1 22 – 3×12 = 192 – 5×42 = 1 52 – 6×22 = 1 82 – 7×32 = 1 Hence, by considering minimal solutions in x for D ≤ 7, the largest x is obtained when D=5. Find the value of D ≤ 1000 in minimal solutions of x for which the largest value of x is obtained.



Problem 67 By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23. 37 4 2 4 6 8 5 9 3 That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23. Find the maximum total from top to bottom in triangle.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 15K text file containing a triangle with one-hundred rows. NOTE: This is a much more difficult version of Problem 18. It is not possible to try every route to solve this problem, as there are 299 altogether! If you could check one trillion (1012) routes every second it would take over twenty billion years to check them all. There is an efficient algorithm to solve it. ;o)



Problem 68 Consider the following "magic" 3-gon ring, filled with the numbers 1 to 6, and each line adding to nine. Working clockwise, and starting from the group of three with the numerically lowest external node (4,3,2 in this example), each solution can be described uniquely. For example, the above solution can be described by the set: 4,3,2; 6,2,1; 5,1,3. It is possible to complete the ring with four different totals: 9, 10, 11, and 12. There are eight solutions in total. TotalSolution Set 94,2,3; 5,3,1; 6,1,2 94,3,2; 6,2,1; 5,1,3 102,3,5; 4,5,1; 6,1,3 102,5,3; 6,3,1; 4,1,5 111,4,6; 3,6,2; 5,2,4 111,6,4; 5,4,2; 3,2,6 121,5,6; 2,6,4; 3,4,5 121,6,5; 3,5,4; 2,4,6 By concatenating each group it is possible to form 9-digit strings; the maximum string for a 3-gon ring is 432621513. Using the numbers 1 to 10, and depending on arrangements, it is possible to form 16- and 17-digit strings. What is the maximum 16-digit string for a "magic" 5-gon ring?



Problem 69 Euler's Totient function, φ(n) [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of numbers less than n which are relatively prime to n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6. n Relatively Prime φ(n) n/φ(n) 2 1 1 2 3 1,2 2 1.5 4 1,3 2 2 5 1,2,3,4 4 1.25 6 1,5 2 3 7 1,2,3,4,5,6 6 1.1666... 8 1,3,5,7 4 2 9 1,2,4,5,7,8 6 1.5 10 1,3,7,9 4 2.5 It can be seen that n=6 produces a maximum n/φ(n) for n ≤ 10. Find the value of n ≤ 1,000,000 for which n/φ(n) is a maximum.



Problem 70 Euler's Totient function, φ(n) [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal to n which are relatively prime to n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.The number 1 is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so φ(1)=1. Interestingly, φ(87109)=79180, and it can be seen that 87109 is a permutation of 79180. Find the value of n, 1 < n < 107, for which φ(n) is a permutation of n and the ratio n/φ(n) produces a minimum.



Problem 71 Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n<d and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction. If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 8 in ascending order of size, we get: 1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8 It can be seen that 2/5 is the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7. By listing the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 1,000,000 in ascending order of size, find the numerator of the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7.



Problem 72 Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n<d and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction. If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 8 in ascending order of size, we get: 1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8 It can be seen that there are 21 elements in this set. How many elements would be contained in the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 1,000,000?



Problem 73 Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n<d and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction. If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 8 in ascending order of size, we get: 1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8 It can be seen that there are 3 fractions between 1/3 and 1/2. How many fractions lie between 1/3 and 1/2 in the sorted set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 12,000?



Problem 74 The number 145 is well known for the property that the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to 145: 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145 Perhaps less well known is 169, in that it produces the longest chain of numbers that link back to 169; it turns out that there are only three such loops that exist: 169 → 363601 → 1454 → 169 871 → 45361 → 871 872 → 45362 → 872 It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually get stuck in a loop. For example, 69 → 363600 → 1454 → 169 → 363601 (→ 1454) 78 → 45360 → 871 → 45361 (→ 871) 540 → 145 (→ 145) Starting with 69 produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but the longest non-repeating chain with a starting number below one million is sixty terms. How many chains, with a starting number below one million, contain exactly sixty non-repeating terms?

Problem 79 A common security method used for online banking is to ask the user for three random characters from a passcode. For example, if the passcode was 531278, they may ask for the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th characters; the expected reply would be: 317. The text file, keylog.txt, contains fifty successful login attempts. Given that the three characters are always asked for in order, analyse the file so as to determine the shortest possible secret passcode of unknown length.



Problem 80 It is well known that if the square root of a natural number is not an integer, then it is irrational.

Problem 86 A spider, S, sits in one corner of a cuboid room, measuring 6 by 5 by 3, and a fly, F, sits in the opposite corner. By travelling on the surfaces of the room the shortest "straight line" distance from S to F is 10 and the path is shown on the diagram. However, there are up to three "shortest" path candidates for any given cuboid and the shortest route doesn't always have integer length. It can be shown that there are exactly 2060 distinct cuboids, ignoring rotations, with integer dimensions, up to a maximum size of M by M by M, for which the shortest route has integer length when M = 100.

Problem 88 A natural number, N, that can be written as the sum and product of a given set of at least two natural numbers, {a1, a2, ... , ak} is called a product-sum number: N = a1 + a2 + ... + ak = a1 × a2 × ... × ak. For example, 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 × 2 × 3. For a given set of size, k, we shall call the smallest N with this property a minimal product-sum number. The minimal product-sum numbers for sets of size, k = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are as follows. k=2: 4 = 2 × 2 = 2 + 2k=3: 6 = 1 × 2 × 3 = 1 + 2 + 3k=4: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4k=5: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2k=6: 12 = 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 2 × 6 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 6 Hence for 2≤k≤6, the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers is 4+6+8+12 = 30; note that 8 is only counted once in the sum.

Problem 89 For a number written in Roman numerals to be considered valid there are basic rules which must be followed. Even though the rules allow some numbers to be expressed in more than one way there is always a "best" way of writing a particular number. For example, it would appear that there are at least six ways of writing the number sixteen: IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII VIIIIIIIIIII VVIIIIII XIIIIII VVVI XVI However, according to the rules only XIIIIII and XVI are valid, and the last example is considered to be the most efficient, as it uses the least number of numerals. The 11K text file, roman.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), contains one thousand numbers written in valid, but not necessarily minimal, Roman numerals; see About... Roman Numerals for the definitive rules for this problem. Find the number of characters saved by writing each of these in their minimal form. Note: You can assume that all the Roman numerals in the file contain no more than four consecutive identical units.



Problem 90 Each of the six faces on a cube has a different digit (0 to 9) written on it; the same is done to a second cube. By placing the two cubes side-by-side in different positions we can form a variety of 2-digit numbers. For example, the square number 64 could be formed: In fact, by carefully choosing the digits on both cubes it is possible to display all of the square numbers below one-hundred: 01, 04, 09, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and 81. For example, one way this can be achieved is by placing {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} on one cube and {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9} on the other cube. However, for this problem we shall allow the 6 or 9 to be turned upside-down so that an arrangement like {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7} allows for all nine square numbers to be displayed; otherwise it would be impossible to obtain 09. In determining a distinct arrangement we are interested in the digits on each cube, not the order. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is equivalent to {3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 5} {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is distinct from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9} But because we are allowing 6 and 9 to be reversed, the two distinct sets in the last example both represent the extended set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9} for the purpose of forming 2-digit numbers. How many distinct arrangements of the two cubes allow for all of the square numbers to be displayed?



Problem 91 The points P (x1, y1) and Q (x2, y2) are plotted at integer co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form ΔOPQ. There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is,0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 2. Given that 0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 50, how many right triangles can be formed?



Problem 92 A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before. For example, 44 → 32 → 13 → 10 → 1 → 1 85 → 89 → 145 → 42 → 20 → 4 → 16 → 37 → 58 → 89 Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at 1 or 89. How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?



Problem 93 By using each of the digits from the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, exactly once, and making use of the four arithmetic operations (+, −, *, /) and brackets/parentheses, it is possible to form different positive integer targets. For example, 8 = (4 * (1 + 3)) / 2 14 = 4 * (3 + 1 / 2) 19 = 4 * (2 + 3) − 1 36 = 3 * 4 * (2 + 1) Note that concatenations of the digits, like 12 + 34, are not allowed. Using the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, it is possible to obtain thirty-one different target numbers of which 36 is the maximum, and each of the numbers 1 to 28 can be obtained before encountering the first non-expressible number. Find the set of four distinct digits, a < b < c < d, for which the longest set of consecutive positive integers, 1 to n, can be obtained, giving your answer as a string: abcd.



Problem 94 It is easily proved that no equilateral triangle exists with integral length sides and integral area. However, the almost equilateral triangle 5-5-6 has an area of 12 square units. We shall define an almost equilateral triangle to be a triangle for which two sides are equal and the third differs by no more than one unit. Find the sum of the perimeters of all almost equilateral triangles with integral side lengths and area and whose perimeters do not exceed one billion (1,000,000,000).



Problem 95 The proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14. As the sum of these divisors is equal to 28, we call it a perfect number. Interestingly the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284 and the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220, forming a chain of two numbers. For this reason, 220 and 284 are called an amicable pair. Perhaps less well known are longer chains. For example, starting with 12496, we form a chain of five numbers: 12496 → 14288 → 15472 → 14536 → 14264 (→ 12496 → ...) Since this chain returns to its starting point, it is called an amicable chain. Find the smallest member of the longest amicable chain with no element exceeding one million.



Problem 96 Su Doku (Japanese meaning number place) is the name given to a popular puzzle concept. Its origin is unclear, but credit must be attributed to Leonhard Euler who invented a similar, and much more difficult, puzzle idea called Latin Squares. The objective of Su Doku puzzles, however, is to replace the blanks (or zeros) in a 9 by 9 grid in such that each row, column, and 3 by 3 box contains each of the digits 1 to 9. Below is an example of a typical starting puzzle grid and its solution grid. A well constructed Su Doku puzzle has a unique solution and can be solved by logic, although it may be necessary to employ "guess and test" methods in order to eliminate options (there is much contested opinion over this). The complexity of the search determines the difficulty of the puzzle; the example above is considered easy because it can be solved by straight forward direct deduction. The 6K text file, sudoku.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), contains fifty different Su Doku puzzles ranging in difficulty, but all with unique solutions (the first puzzle in the file is the example above). By solving all fifty puzzles find the sum of the 3-digit numbers found in the top left corner of each solution grid; for example, 483 is the 3-digit number found in the top left corner of the solution grid above.



Problem 97 The first known prime found to exceed one million digits was discovered in 1999, and is a Mersenne prime of the form 26972593−1; it contains exactly 2,098,960 digits. Subsequently other Mersenne primes, of the form 2p−1, have been found which contain more digits. However, in 2004 there was found a massive non-Mersenne prime which contains 2,357,207 digits: 28433×27830457+1. Find the last ten digits of this prime number.



Problem 98 By replacing each of the letters in the word CARE with 1, 2, 9, and 6 respectively, we form a square number: 1296 = 362. What is remarkable is that, by using the same digital substitutions, the anagram, RACE, also forms a square number: 9216 = 962. We shall call CARE (and RACE) a square anagram word pair and specify further that leading zeroes are not permitted, neither may a different letter have the same digital value as another letter. Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, find all the square anagram word pairs (a palindromic word is NOT considered to be an anagram of itself). What is the largest square number formed by any member of such a pair? NOTE: All anagrams formed must be contained in the given text file.



Problem 99 Comparing two numbers written in index form like 211 and 37 is not difficult, as any calculator would confirm that 211 = 2048 < 37 = 2187. However, confirming that 632382518061 > 519432525806 would be much more difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits. Using base_exp.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 22K text file containing one thousand lines with a base/exponent pair on each line, determine which line number has the greatest numerical value. NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the example given above.
